# Snake

<p>This is a basic Snake game coded mainly in C and mainly uses the SDL3 library. My SDL3 version of my Snake game is a lot better than my SDL2 version. No graphical bugs as far as I can tell. Downloading SDL3 is not required to run this program as the entire library is already inside this project.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>To access Snake, you will need to download the entire repository in a zip folder and unzip it on your computer. This folder will contain the entire SDL3 library and all source files for the game including the font and source code in which you can change to your liking. If you want to play Snake on Windows, you will need to have access to a Unix-like terminal (e.x.: MYSYS2). If you want to play Snake on Linux, you need is your normal terminal and Wine. I'm not sure how Macs work as I'm writing this, so I'll ignore them for now. In your terminal, change the terminal directory to the project folder. If you're on Windows, run "./build.bat". If you're on Linux, run "wine cmd < build.bat" (not sure if this command works 100%; if you're reading this, I haven't tested it yet). After running, the game should automatically launch but if it doesn't you can always launch it automatically. If you already have SDL3 installed on your computer and you don't want to waste storage, edit the source code and batch script to instead use your SDL3 version's files.</p>

<h2>Other Information</h2>

<p>This is my first time making something in C, so bugs/glitches will probably occur. I tried adding as many informational comments in my code as I could without it being too much. I'll add more features over time, like speed powerups, a better pause/game over menu, savable scores, more customizability, etc.</p>
